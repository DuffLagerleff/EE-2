## What is this?

Here's the expansion for Europe Mod #2, but you still can use it as a separate mod for UnCiv.
This mod adds 7 different nations with their unique units & buildings/tile improvements. Unluckily the civs don't have their unique abilities, but it could be fixed soon*.
Also it adds 3 new resources, 4 non-unique buildings, 4 non-unique tile improvements, 1 non-unique unit Esquire and 1 Wonder The World's End.

## Roadmap




- Pack #3

- Europe Launcher*

## Terms

- Mod made for UnCiv developed by Yairm

- Most of Icons could be found on Thenounproject.com

# *Europe Launcher

It's an official announcement by DuffLagerleff which will introduce you to the special launcher for Europe Expansions with Unique Abilities of civs inside it.
